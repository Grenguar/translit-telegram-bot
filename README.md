# translit-telegram-bot
Telegram Bot for transliterating from Cyrillic to Latin letters.

## Usage

Find already deployed bot in telegram - **@translit_ru_bot**

Start writing in Russian or English.

It will automatically translate the words. (For now, mixing letters from different languages is not working)

Don't want to install Russian keyboard layout?

The bot can work in inline mode.
You need to mention the bot in the chat and type the string for transliteration.
